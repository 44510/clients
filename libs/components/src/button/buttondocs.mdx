# Buttons

Use buttons for actions in forms, dialogs, tables, and more.

<ArgsTable of={ButtonDirective} />

<Source id="component-library-button--primary" />

## Choosing between `<a>` and `<button>`

Call to actions (CTAs) can use either the `<a>` or `<button>` html elements; choose which based on the action the button takes: if navigating to a new page, use an `<a>` if taking an action on the current page use a `<button>`.

## Placement

For pairings in the bottom left corner of a page or component, the primary CTA will go on the left side of a button group with the secondary CTA option on the left. Parings in the top right corner of a page, should have the Primary CTA on the right.

## Styles

There are 3 main button styles: Primary, Secondary, and Danger.

### Primary

Use the `primary` styling for an action that relate to the main purpose of a page. There should never be 2 `primary` styled buttons next to each other.

<Story id="component-library-button--primary" />

### Secondary

The `secondary` styling should be used for secondary page action. An action is `secondary` if it relates indirectly to the purpose of a page. There may be multiple secondary actions next to each other; however, generally there should only be 1 or 2 calls to action per page.

<Story id="component-library-button--secondary" />

### Danger

Use the Danger styling when the user may preform a permanent action.

<Story id="component-library-button--danger" />
